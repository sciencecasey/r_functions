# Master R repo

* note: many of the functions are inefficient as they were created to maximize clarity transitioning from the core math concepts to R
  * the heavy use of comments are designed to promote clarity over time
  * there are plans to update these later including more efficient options and examples
* most of the algorithms are run with iris and/or numbers dataset for Algorithms for Data Science at Johns Hopkins course, spring 2021


I do not claim to be an R expert, but I am commited to learning the core concepts on my own over time.   Please note any comments with sources that are not me for subsequent codeblocks are cited as I am simply practicing from others' techniques in order to develop my own
